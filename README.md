# Java-Cluster-Point-Project
This was a project I did for my data structures class. It is a program where you load in a txt file with coordinates on it. Where the
first coordinate pair is the origin point. From there the project will use a prioirty queue to sort out the points from who is closest to
the origin point. You can grab n number of points closest to the origin point by giving n through the input.
